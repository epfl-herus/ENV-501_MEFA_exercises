    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with one part of a car. The front panel is a static piece (see Figure 1), which is used to keep other parts of the car together. It does not have any other mechanical function. A supplier to the automotive industry faces a decision regarding the choice of material for this new structural part. The development department of the company has selected three materials that could satisfy the functional and production requirements. The three materials selected are steel, aluminum and a thermoset composite (polyester-based sheet molding compound). As a first step, study in details the case of aluminum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with the decision making, this exercise evaluates the life cycle primary energy use and CO2 emissions of the aluminum front panel using a simplified Input-Output matrix. Its weight is 5.9 kg and it lasts for the average lifetime of an automobile or approximately 200’000 km. The amount of fuel specifically required to carry the front panel over this distance is 30.4 liters.\n",
